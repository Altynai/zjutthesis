Recently, main memory database is a very hot technology, 
in a main memory database, the whole database is entirely in memory, 
which can provide extremely high data processing speed, 
and the hard disk is only used for persistent backup of the database. 
Among the main memory databases, 
Redis is a representative Key-Value database system with high-performance. 
Our memory database is based on Redis wihich combined with SQLite, 
which implements the basic SQL statements of operations on redis. 
Also, the GUI development is based on PyQt4. 
Mainly related technology includes data storage, data persistence, etc.

Our main memory database system supports not only Redis's original command but also 
some basic SQL operations (Create, Select, etc.).
At the same time, according to the Redis Server configuration, the entire SQLite 
database dumps into a single file.
Also, we compared the main memory databse with the popular relational database MySQL (5.5), 
including the read/write speed difference between them.

The last section contains the compared results of two database, followed by some analysis, evaluation and summary.
